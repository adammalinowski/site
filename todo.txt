Todo


write some posts!!!
- contact
- disclaimer
- some other stuff


general:
- improve draft error handling
  - handle no-metadata error and output if otherwise ok
  - make amount of detail output for failed drafts controllable with command line
- fix links so they work both locally and as html site
  - for now can stick to relative links...
- handling for un-publishing? also version/overwrite/removal handling
- refactor everything
- fix verbosity argparser issue
- command line test, more options
- xotd (or not?!)
- testing!
- warnings
- description field
- internal anchors for paragraphs?
- rss/atom


style:
- make footer links not links when you are on that page. sort out darkstyle :visited issue
- improve style (links, footer)
- figure out ff browser width confusion (1660???)


markup:
- inline tags (different class)
- internal links (semi-auto and explicit, plus different class)
- fix lists (allow line immediately before list)
- quotes (inner & block)
- optional line breaking?
- commas (& other) after links


general thinking:
- notes somehow distinct? is anything not notes?
- blog posts seem different to notes. you want them ordered by date created.
  for notes date created is not that important, since the idea is for the file
  to be somewhat timeless and continually updated


deployment
- set mime type and other meta header things
- deploying changes script
- email


misc
- favicon
- / and home.html?
