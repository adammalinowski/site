general:
- improve style (links, metadata, footer, title...)
- handling for un-publishing? also version/overwrite/removal handling
- xotd (or not?!)
- make thing to handle errors in drafts, and output something useful at least
- testing!
- fix links so they work both locally and as html site
  - for now can stick to relative links...
- warnings:
  - trailing char after link e.g. http:example.com,
- javascript dynamic TOC?
- description field
- internal anchors for paragraphs?

markup:
- inline tags (different class)
- internal links (semi-auto and explicit)
- fix lists (allow line immediately before list)
