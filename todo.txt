in order to have line followed by list, need to not have paragraph but
brs. which means you dont get the top margin. which means... what
everything shou;d instead push down? dont really understand the styling.

general:
- fix homepage
- make logging less awful
- dark style links
- handling for un-publishing? also version/overwrite/removal handling
- description field
- internal anchors for paragraphs?
- xotd
- publish source, add link to each post
- make thing to handle errors in drafts, and output something useful at least
- testing!
- fix links so they work both locally and as html site
  - for now can stick to relative links...
- warnings:
  - trailing char after link e.g. http:example.com,

markup:
- fix lists
- quotes (inner & block)
- optional line breaking?
- inline tags
- commas (& other) after links
