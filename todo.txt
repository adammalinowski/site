Todo


write some posts!!!
- contact
- disclaimer
- some other stuff


general:
- how to handle versioning, date updating (when changing a file).
- improve draft error handling
  - make amount of detail output for failed drafts controllable with command line
- fix links so they work both locally and as html site
  - for now can stick to relative links...
- handling for un-publishing? also version/overwrite/removal handling
- refactor everything
- fix verbosity argparser issue
- command line test, more options
- xotd (or not?!)
- testing!
- warnings
- description field
- internal anchors for paragraphs?
- rss/atom


style:
- make footer links not links when you are on that page. sort out darkstyle :visited issue
- improve style (links, footer)
- figure out ff browser width confusion (1660???)


markup:
- allow empty lines in code blocks!!!!
- lists
	- don't give ul/ol's a margin because nested lists look rubbish. but then adjacent lists aren't seperated.
	  but then why would you ever want adjacent lists?!
	- allow line immediately before list? trick would be to just not wrap it in p, somehow. but don't want to have
	  to mess with source text to achieve this. so only way would be to have special handling in parser...
- inline tags (different class)
- internal links (semi-auto and explicit, plus different class)
	- want to be able to neatly
		- link within a document
		- link to other docs on same site
	- want internal link to possibly look different (i.e. have a different class)
- quotes (inner & block)
- optional line breaking?


general thinking:
- notes somehow distinct? is anything not notes?
- blog posts seem different to notes. you want them ordered by date created.
  for notes date created is not that important, since the idea is for the file
  to be somewhat timeless and continually updated


misc
