Todo


write some posts!!!
- disclaimer
- contact
- some other stuff

general:
- refactor everything
- fix verbosity argparser issue
- command line test, more options
- handling for un-publishing? also version/overwrite/removal handling
- xotd (or not?!)
- make thing to handle errors in drafts, and output something useful at least
- testing!
- fix links so they work both locally and as html site
  - for now can stick to relative links...
- warnings
- description field
- internal anchors for paragraphs?
- rss/atom

style:
- make footer links not links when you are on that page. sort out darkstyle :visited issue
- fix h3 toc
- figure out ff browser width confusion (1660???)
- improve style (links, footer)

markup:
- inline tags (different class)
- internal links (semi-auto and explicit, plus different class)
- fix lists (allow line immediately before list)
- quotes (inner & block)
- optional line breaking?
- commas (& other) after links

general thinking:
- notes somehow distinct? is anything not notes?
- blog posts seem different to notes. you want them ordered by date created.
  for notes date created is not that important, since the idea is for the file
  to be somewhat timeless and continually updated

deployment
- figure domain
- figure hosting (s3 probably)
- static assets on cloudfront?
- deploying changes script
- email
