in order to have line followed by list, need to not have paragraph but
brs. which means you dont get the top margin. which means... what
everything shou;d instead push down? dont really understand the styling.

general:
- homepage
- style links
- warnings:
  - trailing char after link e.g. http:example.com,
- handling for un-publishing? also version/overwrite/removal handling
- tags
- description field
- internal anchors for paragraphs?
- xotd

markup:
- fix lists
- quotes (inner & block)
- optional line breaking?
- inline tags
- commas (& other) after links
