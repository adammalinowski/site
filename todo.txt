Todo


general:
- refactor everything
- handling for un-publishing? also version/overwrite/removal handling
- xotd (or not?!)
- make thing to handle errors in drafts, and output something useful at least
- testing!
- fix links so they work both locally and as html site
  - for now can stick to relative links...
- warnings:
  - trailing char after link e.g. http:example.com,
- description field
- internal anchors for paragraphs?

style:
- make footer links bold when visited. sort out darkstyle :visited issue
- fix h3 toc
- fix toc in chrome css
- improve style (links, footer)

markup:
- inline tags (different class)
- internal links (semi-auto and explicit)
- fix lists (allow line immediately before list)
- quotes (inner & block)
- optional line breaking?
- commas (& other) after links

general thinking:
- notes somehow distinct? is anything not notes?
- blog posts seem different to notes. you want them ordered by date created.
  for notes date created is not that important, since the idea is for the file
  to be somewhat timeless and continually updated
